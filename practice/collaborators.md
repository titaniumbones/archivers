Qri is a startup dedicated to reducing the friction surrounding working with open data. The project was founded by Brendan O'Brien in April of 2016 after it took him more than 20 hours to assemble the data necessary to answer a single question.

Qri is dropping everything to jump start this project. We will be contributors, but are in no way the owners of this project. Once this library is up & running, we aim to build Qri on top of these efforts. It's Qri's long-term goal to be a 10-25% contributor to new code moving forward, providing long term stewardship in partnership with anyone who cares to lend a hand.
