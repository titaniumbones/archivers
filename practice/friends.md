### [Data Refuge](https://datarefuge.org)
DataRefuge helps to build refuge for federal data and supports climate and environmental research and advocacy. We are committed to fact-based arguments. DataRefuge preserves the facts we need at a time of ongoing climate change. 

### [Environmental Data & Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org)
The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) is an international network of academics and non-profits addressing potential threats to federal environmental and energy policy, and to the scientific research infrastructure built to investigate, inform, and enforce.  Dismantling this infrastructure — which ranges from databases to satellites to models for climate, air, and water — could imperil the public’s right to know, the United States’ standing as a scientific leader, corporate accountability, and environmental protection.

### [qri.io ("query-dot-I-O")](http://qri.io)
Qri is a startup dedicated to reducing the friction surrounding working with open data. The project was founded by Brendan O'Brien in April of 2016 after it took him more than 20 hours to assemble the data necessary to answer a single question.

Qri is dropping everything to jump start this project. We will be contributors, releasing as much code as possible to make this library vision a reality. Once this library is up & running, we aim to build Qri on top of these efforts, many parts of which will also be released as open-source softward.

We do not consider ourselves the "owners" of this project. It's Qri's long-term goal to be a 10-25% contributor to new code moving forward, providing long term stewardship in partnership with anyone who cares to lend a hand. 

All code released by Qri for this project will be under liberal licenses. You should feel ownership over the work qri produces, because we need you to help make this great. We release code under the qri.io name because we're committed to maintaining it long term.
