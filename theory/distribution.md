# 1.1.0 Distribution

Distribution deals with the question of _where_ information is located. 

1. Information is the basis of knowledge.
2. Distribution prevents destruction.
3. Distributing information prevents the destruction of knowledge.

### 1.1.1 Information is the basis of knowledge.

It's important to distinguish _information_ from _knowledge_. Information is innert. A book sitting on a shelf, or bits sitting on a hard drive are information, not knowledge. Only when we take that book off the shelf, or load the document the bits represent can information become knowledge.

Value is created when we engage with information, animating it into knowledge. Knowledge always has _some_ value, however small or large, and the size of that value is determined by us when we engage with information. 

We can infer a few things about knowledge & information from this:
* We cannot create knowledge with information we do not have.
* Our library can only be made of information, requiring engagement to create knowledge.
* Knowledge and it's value cannot be dissociated.

### 1.1.2 Distribution prevents destruction.

If information exists in two places, it must be removed from both places to be destroyed. The more information exists, the more difficult it is to destroy. In order to exist in two places, the information in question must be _the same_. Lots of copies keeps stuff safe.

Distributing copies of the same information not only decreases the chance of destruction, distribution perportionately increases availability. Distribution applies to geography as well as enumeracy, creating the incentive to push copies across great distances. It makes sense to place copies of information in remote regions of the world, as this decreases the chance of destruction while at the same time democratizing access.

Our library should exist in many places, and those places should be as far apart as possible, as distrubtion prevents destruction and enhances access.

### 1.1.3 Distributing information prevents the destruction of knowledge.

Or library will contain lots of information, lots of _potential knowledge_. It will be up to us to understand that potential, and guard against abuses. As such from the beginning we should build systems that identify information who's knowledge does more harm than good. We must provide tools for voting against information we find causes harm.

To understand the full ramifactions of distributing information, we must realize that the value knowledge carries can be excercised, with effects that could be beneifical, harmful, innert or anything in between.

Some values lend themselves more to harm or more to good, but we cannot separate "good" knowledge from "bad" knowledge.  "good", and "bad" are both values associated with knowledge, not information. There are kinds of information that should _not_ be distributed widely. Our passwords are a great example. Instructions on how to create weapons may be another.

It is important to understand that we cannot have a library that is both distributed and free from the potential for abuse. It will always be up to each of us to do whatever we can to ensure that our collective values are reflected within the information we add to the library. Ultimately the value we create through distributing information will depend on each of us, and the decisions we make.
