# 1.2.0 Participation

Participation is consideration of _who_. Who can consume knowledge? Who can add knowledge? Who can remove knowledge? What constitutes a participant?

Participation is defined by the following syllogysm:
1. The public is a collection of identities.
2. Communication is one identity sending information to another identity.
3. Participation is public communication.

## 1.2.1 The public is a collection of identities.

Here it is important to detangle the concepts of people, groups, identity and anonymity:

* A person is an individual.
* A Group is a collective reference to a set of people.
* An _identity_ is a unique, concrete record.
* Anonymity is the degree to which an identity is known.

When we say _anyone_, we're actually talking about any _identity_, which is a specific record. That record may be tied to a group, a person, or nothing, but the identity must be concrete.

_Concrete records_ (identities) are the metric upon participation is measured, not the traditional notion of "person". This has the effect of broadening who can participate. A person can have multiple identites, choosing the appropriate identity for a given type of participation. A group can have an identity, allowing many people to act in concert. Finally, this abstracts participation away from the notion of what constitues a person, a subject that is beyond the primary concern of recording "who's done what".

Secondly, an identity can exist anywhere on a spectrum of anonymity. An identity can be _effectively anonymous_ by electing to provide no information about their identity. Conversely an identity can become _well known_ by connecting qualifying information to that identity. _Total anonymity_ is not possible, given the requirement that identity be concrete, just as it is also impossible to be _truly known_.

What is forbidden, however, is _impersonation_, or pretending to be an unowned identity must be prevented not because it is morally wrong, but because it undermines the concrete record that an identity is singular. We should build our library to naturally challenge identities at every turn to automatically guard against impersonation.

It's important that this library treat start with the assumption that all participant are equals, regardless of weather they're a five year old or a government. It should be beyond the scope of this library to make value jugements about identities, and instead leave those decisions to the members of the public. We know that there are many reasons that someone may need to conceal who they are. At the same time we know that when someone places their real name on something, they understand that they can be held accountable for it, but making these judgements on the behalf of others introduces bias that some members may not be comfortable with. This gives the public the power to make their own decisions about the credibilty (or lack theirof) of any given identity. We may choose to ascribe more value to known identities, but what's important is that the choice remain each of ours.

## 1.2.2 Communication is one identity sending information to another identity.

It's important to define what is and is not "communication". First, all communication must be _attributed to an identity_. When knowledge is copied, moved, added, or deleted, it must always be connected to a concrete identity to constitute communication.

None of this is to say that private communication (communication unknown to the public) is forbidden, simply that such communication won't be acknowledged as part of this undertaking.

## 1.2.3 Participation is public communication.

When an identity sends a message that another identity is free to repeat, we have the basis for participation.
