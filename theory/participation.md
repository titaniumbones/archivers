# 1.2.0 Participation

Participation is consideration of _who_. Who can consume knowledge? Who can add knowledge? Who can remove knowledge? What constitutes a participant?

1. The public is a collection of identities.
2. Communication is one identity sending information to another identity.
3. Participation is public communication.

## 1.2.1 The public is a collection of identities.

Here it is important to detangle the concepts of people, groups, identity and anonymity:

* A person just that, a single human (for now...), eg: "Chuck", "Aisha"
* A Group is some way of referring to a set of people. For example "Google employees", "Toronto Blue Jays", or "My parents"
* An _identity_ is a unique, concrete record 
* Anonymity is the degree to which an identity is known.

When we say _anyone_, we're actually talking about any _identity_, which is a specific record. That record may be tied to a group, a person, or nothing, but the identity must be concrete.

_Identities_ are the fundamental unit of counting distinct participants, not the traditional notion of "person". This has the effect of broadening who can participate. A person can have multiple identites, choosing the appropriate identity for a given type of participation. A group can have an identity, allowing many people to act in concert. Finally, this abstraction allows identities to be attributed to machines, as sometimes it's more pertinent to know the software that is doing the communicating. Machines will contribute a great deal of information to our library, and just like people they will make mistakes. By broadening the definition of "identity", this connection is easier to conceptualize.

An identity can exist anywhere on a spectrum of anonymity. An identity can be _effectively anonymous_ by electing to provide no information about their identity. An identity can just as easily become _well known_ by connecting qualifying information to that identity. _Total anonymity_ is not possible, given the requirement that identity be concrete, just as it is also impossible to be fully known, whatever that means.

What is forbidden, however, is _impersonation_, or falsely pretending to be an unowned identity. This must be prevented not because of any moral wrongdoing, but because it undermines the concrete record that an identity is backed by. If an identity is compromised, it becomes impossible to separate the actions of the identity owner from the impersonator. We should build our library to naturally challenge identities at every turn to automatically guard against impersonation. Compomised identities should be noted as such and removed from use.

It's important that this library treat all participant are equals, at least initially. Regardless of weather an identity is connected to a teenager or a government. It should be beyond the scope of this library to make value jugements about identities, and instead leave those decisions to us. We know that there are many reasons that someone may need to conceal who they are. At the same time we know that when someone places their real name on something, they understand that they can be held accountable for it, but making these judgements on the behalf of others is amounts to the introduction of systemic bias. We must be welcome to build opinions about which identities are or are not valuable, but without an equal-footing starting point, it's impossible to make such distinctions.

This gives the public the power to make their own decisions about the credibilty (or lack theirof) of any given identity. We may choose to ascribe more value to known identities, but what's important is that the choice remain each of ours.

## 1.2.2 Communication is one identity sending information to another identity.

It's important to define what is and is not communication. First, all communication must be _attributed to an identity_. When information is copied, moved, added, or deleted, it must always be connected to a concrete identity to constitute communication.

This _attribution requirement_ has a wonderful byproduct. If all identites are unique, all communication

None of this is to say that private communication (communication unknown to the public) is forbidden, simply that such communication won't be acknowledged as part of this undertaking.

## 1.2.3 Participation is public communication.

When an identity sends a message that another identity is free to repeat, we have the basis for participation.
