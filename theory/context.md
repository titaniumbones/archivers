# 1.3.0 Context

Context deals with the question of _what_. Here we'll put the former two conclusions together to form _what_ it is we should do.

1. Distributing information prevents the destruction of knowledge.
2. Participation is public communication.
3. Distributed participation creates public knowledge.

_see [1.1.3](theory/distribution.md) & [1.2.3](theory/participation.md) for the first two principles_

### 1.3.3 Distributed participation creates public knowledge.

Here we arrive at a set of principles that both propagate the library and provide a base context to work from. If we all engage in distributing information, our library _will build itself_.

If we participate in communicating information (and information about information aka metadata) with each other, and keep copies of those communications, the communication itself fills the library with semantic value.

To give an example: If I send a book to you, and you make a copy, and then you send a book to a friend, and they make a copy, we have achieved distribution. If you then make notes about that book & send it to your friend, I can ask you & your friend for your notes. Now we have not only a distributed copy of the book, but distributed context, and with each of us having a copy of the book, there's a much better chance we'll read it, especially if your notes say it's a great book.
